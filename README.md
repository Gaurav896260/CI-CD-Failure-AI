CI/CD Failure AI
================

Goal: Utilize AI/ML to analyze past CI/CD logs and predict build failures before they occur.

Features:
- Predict build failures using machine learning.
- Integrate the AI model into CI/CD pipelines.
- Visualize logs and predictions with Grafana.

Steps to Build:
1. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline
   - Select a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD).
   - Create a pipeline for a sample app (e.g., Node.js or Python app).

2. Collect CI/CD Logs
   - Enable logging and store logs in a structured format (JSON).
   - Use PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch for log storage.

3. Train an AI Model
   - Use Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.
   - Train an ML model to detect failure patterns in logs.

4. Integrate Models Into CI/CD Pipeline
   - Add a prediction step before pipeline execution.
   - Trigger alerts or skip steps based on predicted failures.

5. Visualize & Improve
   - Use Grafana to create a dashboard for log insights and predictions.
   - Continuously fine-tune the AI model with real-world data.

Technologies Used:
- CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD.
- Database: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch.
- Programming: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.
- Visualization: Grafana.
